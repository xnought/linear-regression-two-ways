# linear_regression_normal_equation

This regression could be used for n features of x as well, but for the sake of simplicity, I just used one feature. 
Therefore this can only be used to graph on a x, y plane, but if the code is changed, could accept any number of features, just make sure to scale the input to reflect that.
